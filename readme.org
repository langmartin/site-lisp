This repository is my collection of elisp packages from all over the
Internet, and also a collection of my own code, all mixed together. It
is not well organized.

    2. Mark all js files
       : m .js$ RET

** Search History
   It is possible to search through your entire history. First, try
   : git log -S'pattern'=
   
   If you know the context a little bit more, it might also work to
   simply pipe the output of git diff
   : git diff p1 p2 | grep 'pattern'
