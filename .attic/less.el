;;; Commentary:

;; View file like a simple `less'. Provide limited less keys, mainly j,
;; k, f, b, g, G, etc.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'less)
;;
;; Then use `M-x less-minor-mode' to toggle `less-minor-mode'.

;; There's also a `view-less.el' in XEmacs. But it does too much for me,
;; i just wanna less keys like j, k, f, b, g, G, not to mess with other
;; keys in major mode.

(defun less-revert-buffer ()
  "Revert quietly"
  (interactive)
  (revert-buffer nil t t))
