\section{About}

I am an experienced developer with an interest in programming
languages and system architecture. I enjoy difficult problems, elegant

\section{Projects}
{\bf Quickcue API} The Quickcue API stores a versioned data set for
synchronizing clients, enforcing the client's knowledge of the version
on updates, and broadcasting diffs to connected clients. It's written
in Clojure and uses PostgreSQL.

{\bf TVA DDS} The nuclear document distribution system is a
replacement for a custom mainframe application. The project was behind
schedule; designed the interface and application and launched on
schedule, allowing the mainframe to be retired.

{\bf YKK/Message DB} A web development database platform designed for
version reconciliation and replication (in 2005). YKK was the initial
build (in Scheme), Message DB was a rewrite (in Python) which entered
production.

{\bf Coptix Deployment System} A system for automatic deployment of
internal projects, including tools for reconciling SQL schema changes,
software versions, and multiple active deployments. Reproducible
server states allowed some measure of hardware independence prior to
the ubiquity of virtualization.
